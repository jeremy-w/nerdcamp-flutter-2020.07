# Day 4: Assessment
## The Plan
- Return to my original focus, outline, then complete my assessment.
- Look into any open questions that block completing that assessment. (Flutter for Web!)
- If time allows, resolve further, less essential TODOs left in my notes for my own curiosity.

## The Writing Prompt
Can we use Flutter for more usual apps (vs branded "experiences" / games)?

Concerns include:

- How readily the UI updates to match platform UI changes
- Accessibility and localization support
- How readily code can be shared across platforms
- And does "across platforms" include the Web (because KMP seems like it barely does, for now)

## Retro
- TODO: fill in at end of day

## Outline
