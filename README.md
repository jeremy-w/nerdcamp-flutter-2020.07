# Assessing Flutter
I've built iOS, Android, and Web apps.
I've [previously looked at React Native](https://github.com/jeremy-w/nerdcamp-react-native-201712).
I've been curious about Flutter, but I haven't had a chance to dig into it.

This week, I'll be looking at whether Flutter seems usable for the day-to-day,
platform-styled apps I'm used to building on iOS in particular.
I'll also be looking to understand how it's architected and works.

## Toolchain
